This project is a simple game where multiple players must cooperate to accomplish a shared goal and win the game. A group of three players must work together to damage the motherboard/CPU. There are two ways to accomplish this task. (1) Deliver a high power surge directly to the CPU causing it to overheat and explode. (2) Stop the cooling fan from spinning, thereby, overheating and damaging the CPU. If either of these has been achieved, the final game question appears on screen and the game is over.

Our game is in line with the given theme of 'cats and computer architecture' since the goal of the game is to destroy the motherboard, and we have cats as a formal element which guides the player to resources needed to win the game.

The serious objective of the game is to get the player thinking about how delicate a motherboard is. By getting them to break the motherboard, we intend for the players to understand what it takes to keep a motherboard functioning properly. The final question used to assess the players knowledge is: "Name two instances when the Motherboard fails?"

## Some formal elements in the game are:

1. The players themselves (3 players required) who take the role of mice on the motherboard trying to mess things up.
2. Power batteries act as interactable/moveable resources the players can use to deliver a high power surge to the CPU.
3. Various platforms and buttons in the environment allow the players to interact with and access different resources that assist with game's objective.
4. The CPU and cooling fan components act as triggers for the destruction of the motherboard and the end of the game.
5. Cats which act as guides to help the players find the necessay resources to win the game.
